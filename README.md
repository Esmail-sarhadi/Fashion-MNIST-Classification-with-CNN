# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-with-CNN
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels). The goal of this project is to create a neural network model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.
